You need to mount the drive containing index in order to run the search queries.So, you need to copy this folder to your drive and then use the ipynb file (https://github.com/shanu-gandhi-iiith/WikiSearchEngine/blob/master/query.ipynb) to run and search in index. You need to simply mount the drive containing the index and then upload the query file in wikiproj folder and it will generate output in same folder or you can manuaaly write queries in ipynb file (write your file name in 2nd cell for running search through a file and uncomment the line "# listqr=linescur2" in cell 3 or simply write the query in cell 3 as given in examples and comment that line commented)
